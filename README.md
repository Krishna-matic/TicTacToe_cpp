# Tic Tac Toe in C++

A simple console-based two-player Tic Tac Toe game implemented in C++ using 2D arrays.

## Features
- Two-player game (Player 1: X, Player 2: O)
- Input validation (prevents overwriting moves)
- Win detection (rows, columns, diagonals)
- Draw detection
- Console-based, easy to run and play

## Rules
1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
2. Players take turns entering the row and column to place their symbol.
3. Player 1 uses `X` and Player 2 uses `O`.
4. The first player to align 3 symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins.
5. If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game is a draw.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/TicTacToe_CPP.git
   
2.Navigate to the project folder:
   g++ tic.cpp -o tic
   
3.Compile the code using g++ (or any C++ compiler):
   g++ tic.cpp -o tic
   
4.Run the executable:
   ./tic   # Linux/Mac
   tic.exe # Windows
